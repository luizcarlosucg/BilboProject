# BilboProject
This is a repository project to practice the best Domain Driven Design skills and techniques. Here i'm trying to use CQRS concepts also, and a lot of good practices and development patterns.  The name Bilbo is a inspiration of Bilbo Baggins character from The Lord of The Rings. Bilbo Baggins love a good adventure. Yeah, so do i! And code, my friends, is a good advencture!!!
